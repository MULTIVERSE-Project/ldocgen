# Introduction to LDocGen

LDocGen is a wrapper around [LDoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/ldoc) designed to make it easier to generate documentation for **gLua** projects. It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to pre-render the documentation pages based on the output of LDoc.

## Why LDocGen?

LDocGen was created to solve some of the issues with LDoc, and to make it easier to generate documentation for **gLua** projects. This project aims to make it easier to generate documentation for **gLua** projects, and to make the documentation pages more accessible and customizable.

### Features

> **Note:**
> This project is still in early development, there are still many features that need to be implemented. If you have any suggestions for features, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](#).

- Pre-rendered documentation pages
  - Documentation pages are pre-rendered using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), allowing for a much more customizable and modern documentation experience.
- Full markdown support
  - LDocGen processes markdown independently from LDoc, allowing for full markdown support in documentation pages.
- Custom tags, specific for gLua
  - LDocGen adds custom tags to LDoc, allowing for more specific documentation of **gLua** projects.
- Easy to use
  - LDocGen is designed to be easy to use, and to make it easy to generate documentation for **gLua** projects.
  - All you need to start using LDocGen is a installed version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), LDoc, and a **gLua** project. LDocGen will handle the rest.

## Usage

Please see the [usage](/guides/Getting-Started/Usage) guide for more information on how to use LDocGen.

## Use Cases

LDocGen is designed to be used for documenting **gLua** projects. It is not designed to be used for documenting Lua projects in general, and may not work as expected if you try to use it for that purpose.
